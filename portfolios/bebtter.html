					<h3>BE BETTER THAN NORMAL </h3>
					<p>Counselling Cell IIT Roorkee Organised a keynote session with Mr. Hitesh Ramchandani who was born with a neuro-condition called, ‘Cerebral Palsy’ that affects muscles, movement, and motor skills. It was caused by medical negligence. The doctors claimed that he would never be able to walk or talk and would never live a normal life. He wanted to prove naysayers wrong and fought hard against the obstacles life had thrown at him! Today, Hitesh is a National Football Para-Athlete, motivational speaker and author of the book- Better Than Normal.</p>
					<p>Mr Hitesh Ramchandani was then on a mission which he states as follows, “My dream is to inspire 100,000 People in 100 days by just 1% to live a Better Than Normal Life!”</p>
					<p>The event was organised in MAC Auditorium and saw a participation of 100+ students.</p>
