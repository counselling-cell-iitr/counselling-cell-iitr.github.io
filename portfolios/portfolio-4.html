					<h3>WORKSHOP ON SUICIDE PREVENTION</h3>
					<p>Since its establishment, the Counselling Cell has always been a prime force behind the organisation of many motivating lectures, workshops and events in the campus .This time also, it wasn`t anything different. On the eve of WORLD SUICIDE PREVENTION DAY, IIT-R students were blessed with the golden words of one of the most prolific speakers, MR. RAMNIK BANSAL, member of The Art of Living Organisation.The session was headed by DOSW Dr. D.K. Nauriyal along with faculty advisors Dr. Pramod Agarwal and Dr.Sudhi Agarwal,Dr.Ravi Bhushan with his wife,Assistant librarian Mr. Amrendra Kumar with his wife,Dr. Ravi Jain with his wife Dr. Renu Jain,Dr.Sudhir Chaudhary with his wife and students' counsellor Dr. Shikha Jain.They were further accompanied by Counselling Cell student team members.</p>
					<p>In his career, Mr. Ramnik Bansal has conducted many motivational lectures in many programs and has earned many laurels and praises for his works. This time, the topic of discussion was to how to prevent the ongoing suicide activities around us.The session started with the question that why people commit suicide . As per him, the biggest reason is their inability to share their problems with others. During complete session, he laid emphasis on the importance to express ourselves.Every time logic doesn`t work. Sometimes, we have to go little bit out of track to enjoy the life. We try to explain everything in terms of logic and when that doesn`t work, we get pressurized</p>
					<p>He kept everyone so much involved in his words that there was a sense of satisfaction and an aroma of purification of mind in the environment. He advised that there needs to be a balance between the logic and emotions in our life.Whenever there is something lost, there is much better to come.The only requirement is that we must see the change with positive insight. Students interacting with him realised that we need to accept the things as they are if we are to cope up with stress. Many of the students doubts were settled with a sense of doing good to others.</p>
					<p>The session ended with a simple but unique message that we should learn to open up.
					The life is a precious gift of God.Respect and enjoy it to the fullest.There are many opportunities waiting for us.
					It just requires time and clear vision to see them. When we start taking things in positive sense, then life becomes full of colours and happiness. Never forget:â€œWhen there is a will, there is a way.</p>
