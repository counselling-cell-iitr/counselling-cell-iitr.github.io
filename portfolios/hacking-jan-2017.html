Sometimes it needs guts to face challenges and capitalise on the small happy moments that one gets in the way. Just to help our friends out and give them some comprehensive tips for the same, Counselling Cell IITR organised a Guest Talk by the IITR alumnus and CEO and Co-founder of hackerearth Mr. Sachin Gupta.</p><p>Mr Sachin Gupta gave a lot of useful tips to succeed in getting the best out of the 4 years at IITR. He focussed on what it takes to make your dreams/visions a reality. Here’s a small excerpt from his talk : “Your college life is beautiful. You’ve got friends, you’ve got a place where you can sleep at anytime you want and a campus which exposes you to so many things. Make the best use of the time you have and put your heart and soul into it. Please work hard. Vivek and I used to spend 14 hours a day on coding. I see a lot of entrepreneurs who want to be at the top without going through the grind work. You can never reach the top without working hard.”</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="project-details"><h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3><p><span>Speaker: </span>Mr Sachin Gupta, CEO and Co-founder of hackerearth</p><p><span>Date:</span> 20 Jan 2017</p><p><span>Venue:</span> LHC 002</p></div></div></div></div></div>
