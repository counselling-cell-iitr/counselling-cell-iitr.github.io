					<h3> HOW TO REDUCE, PREVENT AND COPE WITH STRESS? </h3>
					<p>A session was organized by Counseling Cell, IIT Roorkee to discuss one of the foremost problems faced by the students during their studies, Stress. Stress is a multidimensional, and an extremely common problem, which is the starting point of several other medical, social, and behavioural ills. People face stress not only in their student life, but more and more in their professional lives, when they join the extremely competitive marketplace, to build their own spot.</p>

                    <p>We had Dr. Vinit Gupta, MBBS, M.D from King GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Medical College, Lucknow, and a practicing Psychiatrist in Dehradun, and his wife Ila Gupta with us to guide us through the session. He completed his M.D. in 1990. Then he was associated with WHO and IMCR from 1990-1991 for several projects, and has been practising since then. He is a member of the IMA, and  has given approximately 200 lectures there. He has presented a paper on the psychology of crime in the National Lokayukta Conference. He is a visiting faculty of Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, Dehradun.</p>

                    <p>The session was an interactive one, and students participated fairly. Most of the queries were related to the competition one faces in studies, and the overemphasis laid on examinations and results, and how it stymies the talented at the cost of text-book learning. Some others were simply related to inferiority complex, and the tendency of students to compare their achievements with others.</p>

                    <p> Some of the sample queries put up by the people were:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>In our final year, full of tensions and worries about our placements, we see our year mates getting good jobs and packages. This creates a sense of fear and stress in us which is quite difficult to avoid. How to overcome this?</li>
                    <li>
                    When Cumulative Grade Points Average (CGPA) is made the prime criteria of shortlisting at most of the interviews and other places, people with CGPA above 9 and no other extra achievements succeed while others who have excelled in many fields while maintaining their CGPA around 7 to 7.5. And this creates frustration and a sense of failure in them. What should they do in such cases?
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In a nutshell, the interaction was very fruitful, and IIT Roorkee Counselling Cell thanks all the audience for turning up for the event, and hopes that the session we organised helps them lead a more balanced and happier life. The Cell remains committed to its goal in helping the students overcome the various obstacles they face during their stay in the Campus, and make them capable to handle their personal and public problems with success.</p>
