Also the fact that this workshop can be a valuable addition to studentsâ€™ preparations for the internship and placement interviews, academic and professional presentations and public speaking in general, Counselling Cell IIT Roorkee conducted a small speech therapy session for students to help them overcome the fear of speech and deal with problems like stammering, stuttering etc. We at counselling cell IIT Roorkee strongly believe that one must be facing his fears instead of running away from them and we encourage each and everyone to do so! We are very fortunate to have a speech therapist in our campus. <b><i>We strongly recommend everyone in need to visit Dr Sunali Dhawan at the IITR hospital and seek any speech related help if needed.</i></b></p><p>The event was organised in LHC and certificates were provided to the participants.</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="project-details"><h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3><p><span>Speaker: </span>Sunali Dhawan</p><p><span>Date:</span> 8th February 2017</p><p><span>Venue:</span> LHC 002</p></div></div></div></div></div>
